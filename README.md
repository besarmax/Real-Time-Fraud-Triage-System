## 📖 Overview

The **Real-Time Fraud Triage System** is a full-stack data engineering project designed to simulate a financial monitoring environment. It ingests a stream of transactional data, processes it against a fraud detection logic layer, and visualizes flagged activities on a live dashboard for review.

The primary goal of this project was to build a robust, **containerized pipeline** that could be deployed to the cloud (AWS EC2) with a single command, demonstrating Infrastructure-as-Code principles and modern DevOps practices.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is composed of three Dockerized services orchestrated via `docker-compose`:

1.  **Database (PostgreSQL):** Persists transaction history and flagged events.
2.  **Fraud Engine (Python):** Generates synthetic transaction streams and applies heuristic rules (e.g., high-value anomalies, velocity checks) to flag suspicious activity.
3.  **Dashboard (Streamlit):** A low-latency frontend that allows analysts to view live transaction feeds and inspect flagged cases.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Since the AWS demonstration instance has been terminated to prevent cost overruns, you can spin up the full environment locally using Docker.

### Prerequisites
* Docker Desktop installed
* Git installed

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/besarmax/Real-Time-Fraud-Triage-System.git
    cd Real-Time-Fraud-Triage-System
    ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You can use the example provided as a template:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Or on Windows Command Prompt: copy .env.example .env

3.  **Build and Run**
    Execute the Docker Compose command to build the images and start the network:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4.  **Access the Dashboard**
    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    `http://localhost:8501`

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Challenges

* **Container Orchestration:** Solved networking challenges between the Python application and the PostgreSQL container by utilizing Docker's internal DNS service discovery.
* **Cloud Security:** Configured AWS Security Groups to strictly limit inbound traffic, allowing access only on specific ports (SSH and Streamlit) while keeping the database port private.
* **State Management:** Implemented logic to handle "skip os shutdown" scenarios and data persistence using Docker Volumes.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* **Machine Learning Integration:** Replace the heuristic rule-based detection with a trained `scikit-learn` Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection.
* **Alerting System:** Integrate AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) to send SMS/Email alerts for transactions over $10,000.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement GitHub Actions to automatically lint code and build Docker images on push.
